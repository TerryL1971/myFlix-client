// Here, React’s compositional architecture is being leveraged by way of a component that’s a function of its props with its own style that can be used later in another view/component:

// myFlix-client/src/a-view/a-view.jsx
const { Button } = '../components/button/button';

/*... in the render function*/
<Button label="Click me!"/>
